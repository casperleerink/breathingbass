Breathing Bass is a Vancouver-based composer-performer ensemble dedicated to collaborative story-telling. They were in-residence at Simon Fraser University in 2019-2020, where they produced an improvised opera titled "Coral calls for Cloud" - a love story inspired by the biochemical conversation between coral reefs and cloud formations. They are now developing online audio-visual artworks that incorporate improvisation and audience participation.
