What struck me as particular was the meticulously handwritten text on the back of the photos, indicating the time and place from which they were taken. Thanks to all the information provided on the back, me and my collaborator, Casper Leerink were able to revisit all the place, some 20 years later.

As newcomers to the city, we were amazed by the idea of being able to witness the drastic changes that have taken place in the city of Vancouver through the eyes of its dweller. It only occurred to us later in the project to research into the photographer: Rod Logan. Turns out, he was not an anonymous nobody whose works have never been discovered. His amazing collection of ships had even had its own exhibition at the Polygon Gallery, an exhibition that I even once visited myself.
