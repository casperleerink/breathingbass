Breathing Bass will stream a 40 minute Sound and Video art piece on Nov. 30, 2020, as an experiential pairing to the total penumbral eclipse visible from Vancouver, BC at that time.

A visual and aural experience of slow-moving music, a focus on the textures of the sound, and a deep supreme joy in reveling in a single sound for what feels like eternity. In this piece, we are exploring our own durational limits of perception and concentration and how we can maintain our own and listener interest through small changes in texture and timbre.
