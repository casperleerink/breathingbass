# Casper Leerink

Casper Leerink (1995) originally had two great affections, Music and Technology. After high school, torn between the two, he chose to pursue a career in music. From 2013 until 2017 he studied Piano performance with Sepp Grotenhuis at ArtEZ University of the Arts in Zwolle, resulting in his graduation in July 2017. Because Casper’s interests grew bigger than the piano, he managed to start a second major at ArtEZ in Composition, for which he studied with Alex Manassen and Wilbert Bulsink.\
After his graduation, Casper moved to Vancouver in Canada to study composition at the [Simon Fraser University](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) where he is currently persuing his Master in Fine Arts with topics in interactive composition and machine learning.

In his compositions Casper seized the opportunity to integrate his two interests. Technology in his compositions have an important role. It is used to connect a variety of features into his compositions, like Dance, Theater, Film and even the Audience. With the help of technology these features aren’t a separate entity but rather part of a whole interactive experience. (In short, they react to each other)\
Using these technologies in his music, Casper tries to create an opportunity for technology to connect people with each other, in a way that benefits both humans and machines.
